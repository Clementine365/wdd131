      <h2> 1 Nephi 3:7</h2>
      <p> And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father:
         I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded,
          for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he
         shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.</p>

      <h2>Mosiah 4:3</h2>
      <p>And it came to pass that after they had spoken these words
         the Spirit of the Lord came upon them, and they were filled with joy,
          having received a remission of their sins, and having peace of conscience,
           because of the exceeding faith which they had in Jesus Christ who should come,
            according to the words which king Benjamin had spoken unto them.</p>
